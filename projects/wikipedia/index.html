            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>Raymond Anthony Jenkins was born in Bartow, Florida in Central Florida,[15] the oldest of five siblings.
                His mother was just 16 at the time of his birth, while his father was absent for most of his life. Not
                much was known about his father's life other that he was a record-setting high school wrestler before he
                was incarcerated for drug-related offenses.[16] As a boy, and the eventual older brother to four younger
                siblings, Lewis quickly became the man of the house. He helped his sisters with their hair and made sure
                his younger brother arrived at daycare on time. When his father's contact became less frequent, he
                abandoned his last name and changed it to the last name of his mother's boyfriend, Ray Lewis, when he
                entered Kathleen High School in Lakeland, Florida.[17]</p>

            <h2>College career</h2>
            <p>Lewis enrolled in the University of Miami, where he was a member of the Miami Hurricanes football
                team.[22] As a freshman, he was an immediate contributor and became a starter for the Hurricanes' final
                five games. He compiled 81 tackles, two sacks, two tackles for loss, and four pass deflections en route
                to being named to the freshman All-American team.[23]</p>
            <h2>Professional Career</h2>
            <p>Lewis suffered torn triceps on October 14, 2012, during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, and had them
                surgically repaired three days later.[150][151][152] Several sources had reported he was expected to
                return to action December 16 in the game against the Denver Broncos,[153] much earlier than his expected
                return in January,[154] but he was inactive for the game.[155] On January 2, 2013, Lewis announced he
                would retire after his team finished the 2012â€“13 NFL playoffs.[156] </p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Throughout his career, Lewis built a reputation as a leader and intimidating force at middle linebacker.
                He has led his team in tackles in 12 of his 14 seasons. The Ravens did not allow a single 100-yard
                rusher in 51 consecutive games from the 1998 through 2001 seasons.[178] In addition to his run defense,
                Lewis has also gained a reputation as a complete defender. His 31 interceptions rank fifth all-time
                among NFL linebackers, and just six short of the top spot. Since the murder allegations, Lewis's image
                has recovered, and today he is considered one of the most dominant linebackers in the history of the
                NFL.[179][180] Lewis was also selected as the third-best linebacker of all time on the show The Sports
                List. A poll of NFL coaches selected him as the most dominant player in the NFL before the 2003 season
                by being mentioned on 10 ballots, while no other player was mentioned more than twice.[181] Team owner
                Steve Bisciotti stated his intention to erect a statue of Lewis outside M&T Bank Stadium. On September
                4, 2014, days before the Ravens season opener, a statue of Lewis was unveiled in front of M&T Bank
                Stadium.[182]</p>
