            The dreams started in bubbles on a piece of paper for the Des Moines native. Two of the goals were
            not only accomplished but changed women’s basketball forever.

            In a March sit-down interview with ESPN’s Holly Rowe, Iowa native Caitlin Clark remembers writing
            her dreams down on a piece of paper filled with bubbles that read ‘Future Dreams’ at the top.

            “I remember one of them [bubbles] was ‘play in the WNBA’ and ‘earn a basketball scholarship,’” Clark
            said. “Obviously college basketball has come true and then hopefully the WNBA here very shortly.”

            Clark was very competitive as a young girl and her parents were well aware of the personality trait.
            The desire to win started for Clark at a young age as she played softball, volleyball, soccer,
            tennis, and golf. And then there was basketball.

            “Especially in basketball,” Clark said. “I always wanted to be the best and there was times where I
            definitely wasn’t or I failed.”

            Perseverance pushed Clark to realize basketball was the perfect fit. College recruitments started to
            pour in during her time in middle and high school. Clark said her high school sophomore year was
            when she really started to focus on her basketball career.

                <p class="columned-text bgblock"> Clark’s college career was full of twists and turns but nothing was
                    more substantial than the moment
                    she
                    became the NCAA Division I all-time leading scorer. But for Clark, the record chase was something
                    that she
                    never thought of too much.

                    “I was aware of it just because of the media and that's what people would talk about a lot,” Clark
                    said. “It was never something like ‘oh my gosh I need to do this or I need to break this.’”</p>
                <p class="columned-text">
                    According to Agence France-Presse news, a French international news agency, a U.S. women's
                    basketball record television audience of 12.3 million people watched superstar Caitlin Clark lead
                    Iowa over rival Louisiana State University in the college playoffs. The previous record was 11.83
                    million viewers for the 1983 final between Southern California and Louisiana Tech on CBS, based on
                    information from the article.

                    According to AFP news, ESPN's previous women's basketball record viewership was 9.9 million people
                    for last year's Iowa and LSU final, but jumped 24% this year to become the top U.S. prime-time
                    program.

            Based on the information published from AFP, the ratings made the Iowa victory the most watched basketball
            game on ESPN since game seven of the 2018 NBA Eastern Conference finals between Boston and the LeBron
            James-led Cleveland Cavaliers. The contest outdrew every Major League Baseball game in more than a year and
            every National Hockey League game since game seven of the 1971 Stanley Cup final between Chicago and
            Montreal.

            On April 15, Clark was selected as the first overall pick in the WNBA draft by the Indiana Fever. According
            to ESPN, the draft averaged a record 2.45 million viewers and the overall viewership peaked at 3.09 million.

            “I think the biggest thing is just be myself and have fun,” Clark said, moments after being drafted by the
            Fever. “And if I do that I think the rest is going to take care of itself.”
